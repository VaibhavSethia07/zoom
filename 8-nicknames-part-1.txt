1. We first save the messages in the unordered list. We take the message create a list item tag and set its innerText to 
message. Next we append the list item in the unordered list. Since, we have 2 forms, we create ids for each one.
form#nickname
form#message

const messageForm=document.querySelector('#message');

2. We add nick names to browsers. For this we create a form and save the nick name as a message. When we send the nickname
to the server, it doesn't differntiate between a message and nickname. So we create a message type which differntiates
between the message and nickname.

3. Instead of sending text in the socket.send(), we send the JSON.
    {
        "type": "message/nickname",
        "payload": "data"
    }
    The socket.send() can only take the string as argument so we stringify JSON and then send it. At the server end we can
    parse it using JSON.parse().

4. We create a function that takes the argument as type and payload and return a JSON in string format.
