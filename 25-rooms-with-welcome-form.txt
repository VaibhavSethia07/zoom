1. We will show the media stream only when the user joins a room. So intially the myFace section is hidden and when the
user, enters the room we hide the welcome form and show the myFace section.

2. Also we use 
    Code Snippet: app.js
    socket.emit('join_room',roomName) 

    server.js
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {

        socket.on("join_room", (roomName, done) => {
            socket.join(roomName);
            done();
            socket.to(roomName).emit("welcome");
        });
    });

    When we join a room only then the done() function executes which the startMedia(). Also when we join a room we send a
    notification to all other users in the room that someone has joined the room which is handled in the app.js using on()
