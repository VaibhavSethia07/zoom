1. We are going to notify everybody that a new room is created. This is done using
    io.sockets.emit('event_name',msg);
   This command sends message to everyone.

2. Here the message is the list of public room. 
   Note: socket.on('event_name', console.log); is same as
         socket.on('event_name,(msg)=>console.log(msg));

3. So we show a list of public rooms when a socket creates a room and display the list of remaining room when the clients
of a disconnect.

4. Note that the `disconnecting` event happens just before the client has left. So the room which is being exiting still
exists. To solve this we use `disconnect` event.

5. We listen to the `created_rooms` event in app.js and populate the list.
