1. To let everyone we disconnected, we use `disconnecting` event. Disconnecting means the client is going to be disconnected
but hasn't left its rooms yet.

2. So when a browser disconnects, we let every room in which the browser was know that the browser left. This is done in
`server.js` because on the app side we don't have access to rooms.

3. On the server side, we emit the event and on the app side we handle the event.

4. Sending a message, we take the input from the form, add an eventlistener for the submit event and then emit the event
`new_message`. While emitting the event, we pass the function which lists our message as `You: message`

5. On the server side, we receive the message, with room and function to be called and handle the event.

Note: While handling submit event and emiting an event store input.value in separate variable because it will conflict with
input.value=""
