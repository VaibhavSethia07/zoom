1. We will create static files. These are the files that will go to our users. In the `src` folder, we create public folder
and its heirarchy.
--> src
    --> public
        --> js
            -->app.js

2. In the `server.js` file, configure pug by setting the view engine and set the path
    app.set('view engine','pug');
3. Create a `views` folder in the `src` folder and the `home.pug`
    --> src
        --> views
            --> home.pug

    app.set('views', __dirname+'/views');
4. Create the '/' endpoint.
5. Add the script to `home.pug`
    script(src="/public/js/app.js")
   This url doesn't work yet- `http://localhost/3000/public/js/app.js`. For this we use midlleware express.static()
   app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname+'/public'))

   Improvement: If we make any changes to views, then nodemon restarts and we don't want that. We want nodemon to restart only
   if we modify the server.
   So we go in `nodemon.json` and ignore "/src/public/*"

Important 6. To make UI look good without doing much CSS, use mvp.css. Go mvp.css and copy the CSS link. This link adds the
default CSS. Add the link to header section of `home.pug`

Run the project using `npm run dev` command.
