Check ws on npm website.
1. ws is simple to use WebSocket client and server implementation. Protocol means some people meet in room and decide how things need to be done.
Developers take these rules and implement them.

2. There are WebSocket implementations for various languages Java, Go, C# etc.

3. Chatrooms that we are going to implement are not available in ws. A group of developers have built a framework that uses ws. It has features like
chatrooms that we don't have to implement on our own.

4. Install ws and we are going to create ws server. We are going to take the express server and put it together with ws server. express is handling HTTP
request and responses and ws handles ws things.
    npm i ws

5. We use `http` module to create server and pass our application as the request listener to it. Next we create ws server on top of this server.
    const server = http.createServer(app);
    const wss= new webSocket.Server({server});

    Note: If we don't want the HTTP server we don't create it, we only create ws server.

6. Now we let server listen to request.
    server.listen(3000,()=>{...})
