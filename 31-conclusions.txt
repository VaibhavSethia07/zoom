Data Channel

1. A data channel is a channel where peer to peer user can send and receive any kind of data. Till now we have been receiving video/audio.

2. We can transfer file, text chat, game update packets. Here there is no need of a server.

3. Read mdn docs related to Data Channel
Note: channel.onopen=function (event){

} 

is same as channel.addEventListener('open',()=>{

})

4. WebRTC cannot be used when we have lots of peer. The reason is in WebRTC the network will become like a complete graph
where every computer is uploading and downloading audio/video from every other peer.

5. Some companines use SFU(Selective Forwarding Unit). This kind of structure depends on a centralised server to which each
computer uploads the stream and from which a computer can download all other streams. 

6. But if we are using Data Channel then we don't have to think about the complete graph because here we are transferring
text which is fast.
