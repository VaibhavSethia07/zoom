1. We need to display the count of people that are in our room. And this count needs to be updated when a person joins/
leaves the room.

2. The count of people can be found from the size of set of socketids stored for the corresponding room in the `rooms` map.

3. We pass the getRoomSize() in the `disconnecting` event because there we have access to roomName.
