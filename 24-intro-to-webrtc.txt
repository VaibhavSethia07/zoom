WebRTC- Web Real Time Communication

1. WebRTC is a technology that allows us to have real-time communication. It is different from SocketIO in the sense that
it is a peer-to-peer communication. 

2. When we built the chat using SocketIO it was not peer-to-peer because there were many websockets that were connected to
1 server. And when 1 websocket sent a message that message was sent from the websocket to the server and then the server
broadcasted the message to everybody else.

3. With WebRTC we have peer-to-peer communication. This means my audio/video and the text is not going to the server but
directly to the other peer. If we has to upload our audio/video to the server and other browser had to download the audio
/video then that server would be very expensive and would fall all the time.

Note: With WebRTC we talk directly, and we do need a server, not to transmit audio and video but for signalling. When the
signalling is done we do the peer-to-peer communication.

4. Why do we need a server for signalling?
How do we know where the other browser is? What is the IP Address of the browser? Is the browser behind a firewall. For all
this we need a server.
