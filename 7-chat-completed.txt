1. In the `home.pug`, we make a form with submit button and unordered list of all messages. This form take a message as
input from the user. The message is then stored in app.js (Browser-side) and then we send the message to server through the
socket.

2. We take the form and message list and listen to the submit event. It gives us an event and we take the input from the
form.

3. We can then send the message to the server using socket.send().

4. We can send the same message back to the browser from server, but we store all the browsers(socket) that are connected to
server. When we receive the message, we send the message to all the browsers(sockets)

        Brave         Chrome
    (down) \        (up) /
            \          /
                Server

This is how the communication takes place.
