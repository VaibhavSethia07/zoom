1. The implementation of WebSockets for real-time communication done till now can be replaced by a framework called Socket.IO (Socketio).

2. Socket.IO is a framework that enables real-time, bidirectional and even-based communication. SocketIO is not an implementation of WebSockets but a framework that provies the mentioned features using WebSockets among other things.

3. SocketIO is more resilient than WebSockets. For eg, if your phone doesn't support WebSockets or if something happens to WebSockets, SocketIO will still work.

4. SocketIO sees if the browser supports WebSocket then it uses WebSocket. If there is a proxy or firewall, Socket.IO will still work. If there are no WebSockets, SocketIO uses HTTP long-polling.

5. In case of SocketIO, if Wi-Fi goes away for 1 ms, SocketIO will try to reconnect which is something we have to code in WebSocket.

6. Most of the casino and gambling websites need real-time communication, so they use SocketIO.

7. SocketIO is heavier than WebSocket. API of SocketIO is very similar to that of WebSocket's.
