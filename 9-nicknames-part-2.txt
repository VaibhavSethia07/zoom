1. The backend does not understand JavaScript objects. So, we need to send strings. We should not rely on the programming
language because the server to which the frontend is connected may not be a JavaScript server. It can be a Java or Go server.
This is why we have to send strings.

2. All the servers on the backend decide what to do with those strings. We turn the string into JSON object using JSON.parse().

3. If the type=='new_message', we send the message to all the other browsers. Otherwise we set the nickname field of the socket.

4. If no nickname was provided we by default set the nickname as 'anonymous'
