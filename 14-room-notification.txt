1. We are going to send a message to everyone in the room that someone has joined.
    Eg- Code Snippet: server.js 
     io.connection("connection",(socket)=>{

        // To 1 room
        socket.to('room name').emit('an event',{data: 'some data'});

        // To many rooms
        socket.to(['room1','room2']).emit('an event',{data: 'some data'});
    })

2. In the frontend, we are going to react to the event using `socket.on()` by
adding message to the unordered list.

3. Note: SocketIO knows we send message to everybody ecept yourself. 

4. To see the output use 1 more browser which will get the joining notification.
