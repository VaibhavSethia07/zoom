1. The logic of adding the nicknames remains the same. We make a form in the room division. We take the nickname and emit
the event `save_nickname` in app.js. The server then listens to the event and saves the nickname as socket['nickname'].
Initially the nickname is set to `anonymous`.

2. Every where update `someone` with nickname. 

3. Code challenge: Till now we are entering the room and then setting our nickname. So whenever we join we join as anonymous.
    So ask the nickname while entering the room.
