HTTP
1. HTTP is a protocol. For eg: http://nomadcoders.co In HTTP, the user sends the request and the server sends the response. For eg: the
user sends a get request and the server responds with a template page.

2. HTTP is stateless. This means that the backend doesn't remember the user and there is no connection between the user and
backend.

3. In authentication, the server forgets who you are. If you want to send the message to server and you are already logged in
then you have to send cookies. The cookies tell who you are and then the server responds with correct profile page.

WebSocket
1. WebSockets help us to do realtime chats and notifications. WebSocket is also a protocol. For eg ws://nomadcoders.co.

2. How does WebSocket work and how does it allow us real-time communication.
    1. The connection in WebSocket is like a handshake. The browser sends a connection request to the server. The server then accepts/deny
    the request. But once the handshake is finished. The connection is established just like a string. Because the browser and server are
    connected, the server remembers who the user is.

    2. Since the browser and server are connected, the server doesn't have to wait for browser to send request. So a browser can send 1
    message and the server can respond with 3 messages.

    3. Finally the connection is closed after the communication is over.
    For eg: Wifi connection with your phone. It is always connected.
