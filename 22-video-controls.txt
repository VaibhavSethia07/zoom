1. We can acces the audioTracks and videoTracks from the streams and invert their enabled property when the corresponding
button is clicked.

Note: getAudioTracks() and getVideoTracks() gives us an array with 1 element.
    Code Snippet: app.js
    stream.getAudioTracks().forEach(track=>track.enabled= !track.enabled);

2. Go to MediaDevices Web API. enumerateDevices() tell all the media input and output devices connected to the computer. We
call the function getCameras() that gives us a list of cameras.

Note: enumerateDevices() returns a promise, so we use try-catch block.

3. From the array of devices we only select the devices with kind: 'videoinput'.

4. In the home.pug, we make a select tag. Grab the select tag in app.js, add options to it with value as deviceId and display
text as label property of device.
