1. The problem is when the phone is not on the same WiFi as our computer, there is an error and peer's stream is not visible. 

2. The reason this is happening because we need a STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server. A STUN server allows
computers to find out their public ip address. Everything used to work before because the 2 browsers were on the same WiFi
so they could find each other.

3. When we connect from phone using mobile data, the phone cannot find the laptop. This is why we need a STUN server. To
fix
this we can add a list of STUN servers when we create a RTCPeerConnection().

Note: We will be using servers provided for free by Google. But if we want to make professional WebRTC service then we
should run our own STUN server.
