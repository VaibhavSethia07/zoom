1. When the user goes to our website, he sees a form that tells them to join/create a room. The conecpt of room helps us to
learn about other things that SocketIO has, for eg: Broadcasting a message to a room.

2. We create a form that takes the room name as input with a button to enter a room. If we join a room that doesn't exist that
means we create a room and then enter a room.

3. Handle the submit event. In the handleSubmit function, we send the room name to server using emit() function. In WebSockets
we used send(). We don't necessarily have to send string, we can send anything.

4. The emit event can be of any type. After emit type, we can send any number of arguments and a function which will be executed
by server in browser.
