1. Rooms are important for WebSockets because the casinos that uses SokcetIO need rooms. For eg: some WebSockets are in a
room where they send messages among each other. Not all WebSockets need to talk to everybody.

Note: A room is a group of WebSockets.

2. Rooms are used in online video games, Tinder. SocketIO supports rooms natively.
    Lets the socket join a room.
    1. socket.join(room_name);
    To know about more functions visit https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-socket-instance/
    `socket.id` gives the id of socket.

    2. socket.onAny((event)=>{
        console.log(`Socket Event: ${event}`);
    })
    socket.onAny() acts like a middleware.

3. Intitally every socket is in a room with itself. So the room has the id same as that of socket. This means all sockets
have private room between itself and server. 

4. We can leave a room or send message to all others in a room.

5. In the form once we join a room we have to hide the form and then show the room.
    Code Snippet: app.js
    const room=document.getElementById('room');
    room.hidden=true

6. After we join a room we call a function `showRoom`. This function hides the original form and unhides the room form. We
call the function on the server.

7.Next we tell people the name of the room where they are. Initially the room name is empty but when we join a room we show
the room name in h3.
